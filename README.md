# FPTOOL Version 0.1
## A compiler for generating fixed-point VHDL code.
### Niels A. Moseley

The fixed-point tool (FPTOOL) takes mathematical expressions and fixed-point input variable definitions, and transforms them into VHDL (or verilog in the future). The compiler takes care of the precision/width of each intermediate result to avoid overflows.

It is designed to be most useful for digital signal processing arithmetic running in a single clock domain.

The compiler can generate multipliers with Canonical Signed Digit (CSD) constants, leading to area-efficient implementations.

Assumptions:

- all variables are SIGNED.
- all intermediate results are scaled to avoid overflow.
- all shift operators are of the arithmetic type and don't drop bits. (SHIFT OPERATION UNSUPPORTED)
- division is unsupported: multiply by 1/x.
- you know what you're doing: optimizations are not done (for now).
- Q(n,m) has 'm' factional bits and 'n' integer bits.
- the number of bits in a Q(n,m) is n+m.
- Q(1,7) has a range of [-1/128 .. 1/127], i.e. it can't represent 1.0 exactly.

Built-in functions:

- saturate(x,n,m) saturates variable 'x' to fit it into a Q(n,m) variable. (STILL UNSUPPORTED)
- truncate(x,n,m) removes (or adds) bits to variable 'x' so it becomes Q(n,m).

Operators:

- regular arithmetic: '+' '-' '*'
- line comment: '%'
- division operator is accepted but code for it will no be generated.

Current project state:

- Lexer is working.
- Parser can check the grammar (Except <<, >>, <<<, >>> and saturate) and build an abstract syntax tree.
- VHDL code generator is working (except for division operator)
- CSD expansion is working.
- Don't use it for production unless you test the output thoroughly!!

## Building
Run `./bootstrap.sh` in the project directory and `ninja` in the created `BUILD` directory.

## Command line options

- "-o VHDLFILENAME" to generate VHDL source code.
- "-g DOTFILENAME" to generate Graphviz/Dot formatted AST dump.
- "-L LOGFILE" to write the output to a log file.
- "-V" to enable verbose output.
- "-d" to enable debug output.

## Internal program flow
* The input file is read by the lexer. It produces a list of tokens.
* The parser analyses the tokens to check the syntax and collect data on variables/identifiers etc. It produces an abstract syntax tree (AST).
* The AST is transformed to a single-static-assigment (SSA) form, i.e. a list of simple assignments.
* Several micro passes (transformations) are performed on the SSA to remove the more complex commands and/or operands, such as multiplcations by a canonical signed digit constant.
* Finally, the VHDL code generate takes the final SSA list and transforms it into VHDL statements and associated documentation.
